#' Time protocol writer
#'
#' Creates and collates time protocol data given minimal information (light pattern and protocol steps)
#'
#' Protocol steps are assumed to follow the scheme:
#'
#' \itemize{
#'
#' \item{0}{: no video (disregarded)}
#' \item{1}{: no light (disregarded)}
#' \item{2}{: lights constantly on}
#' \item{3}{: lights on in a blinking pattern}
#' \item{4}{: quadrants on, NE and SW}
#' \item{5}{: quadrants on, NW and SE}
#'}
#'
#' This is primarily for the collapse of 4 and 5 into a single chunk.
#'
#' There is currently no data cleanup. The underlying noise therefore shows up in frame variability (~4 frame jitter).
#'
#' @param lit a boolean or 0-1 integer vector indicating frames with lights on or off
#' @param prot a list of protocol steps, in order; it can contain 0's and 1's, but only 2-5 are actually used
#' @param sec3 an optional section 3 add-on to stick the last 2s back onto the protocol (input in frames!!!)
#'
#' @return
#'
#' A data frame containing the columns \code{time} (frame number), \code{lit} (lights on or off, 0-1 integer),
#' \code{chunk} (broad section definer including on frames and surrounding off frames), \code{section} (narrow section
#' definer attributing values to each on and off time separately), \code{rept} (repeat: used in conjunction with \code{section}
#' to uniquely identify each lights-on event) and various timers centered at the appropriate light-on time (\code{chunktimer},
#' \code{sectiontimer}, and \code{lighttimer}).
